[Arduino Project Description](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/samanfern/bluetooth-controlled-car-c71cd0)

This project description includes the hardware components and basic code for controlling the RC Car through bluetooth. This project can be used as a starting point for how we want to utilize each motor to control the car with code.

## RC Car Control Programming

[High level design of RC car programming and user interface](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/126859/RC-Car-Control-Programming)

This project gives an overview of how the user interface (through Winforms C# application) can remotely connect to the car and send controls and commands. This is useful to see how we want to send commands to our car. (remotely, or plug in to upload code?)
