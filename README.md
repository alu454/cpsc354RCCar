TODO: Short motivation and description of the project.

This project, by using the Blockly API, directly applies to the topics of parsing, interpretation, and compilation. 
Blocks will be dragged/dropped around a user-friendly GUI to control the RC Car. 
These blocks will then be parsed and interpreted as C code to directly control the car. 
This C code will then be compiled into a file that will be loaded onto the hardware of the car to execute the control sequence designed by the program. 
By using the Blockly API and generating C code as a middle-man step in controlling the RC Car, it allows users to easily control the car without needing the knowledge of a programming language like C.

TODO: Create a file 'design.md' that contains a preliminary design of at least some of the blocks of the DSL together with their semantics (that is, with a (possibly high-level) description of the code that will be executed when the block is called).
